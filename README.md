This allows me to play around with the results of `https://github.com/AkshatM/benchmark_envoy`.

Run `npm install` to get all dependencies.

To use, move the contents of `/root/results` from the machine instance (or unpack the tar archive produced,
and note the `root/results` path in it) into a directory called `results` at the top level of this repository.

Then, run `gulp`.
